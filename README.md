## A service for updating college football data in realtime

This is a service for grabbing play by play data and outputting it to Google Drive in realtime as college football games are completed. It currently outputs into JSON, flattened JSON, and CSV formats. Once a game is marked as completed, play by play data should be available within one minute.
